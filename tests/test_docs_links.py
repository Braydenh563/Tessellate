"""Every relative link and anchor in the user-facing documents resolves.

The README, the root guides and the documents under `docs/` link to each
other and to the screenshots. Nothing checked those links: a renamed file or
heading left a link that read as plausible and went nowhere, and the one place
a first-time reader clicks (the README's table of documents) was the likeliest
to rot. `test_docs_layout.py` covers the roadmap's own cross-links and
`test_readme_freshness.py` the screenshots; this covers the rest.

What it checks, for each file below:

- a Markdown link or an HTML `src`/`href` that is not an address on the web
  points at a file or folder that exists, resolved from the file that holds it;
- a `#anchor` on a Markdown target names a heading that file really has,
  spelled the way GitHub spells its ids (lower case, punctuation dropped,
  spaces to hyphens, a repeated heading numbered);
- a `#anchor` on its own names a heading in the same file.

Code fences and inline code are skipped: a link shown as an example is not a
link. The mirrored copies under `docs/` (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`) are byte-identical to the root files, which
`test_docs_site.py` enforces, so only the originals are read here: their links
are written for the repository root.
